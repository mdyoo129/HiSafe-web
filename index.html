          <p>
            Hi!
            I'm Dyo (Muhamad Dyo Rijki Fadillah - 1237050076), a third year college student at Sunan Gunung Djati State Islamic University, interested and starting to learn on Data Science also Graphics Design.As an informatics engineering major. I open my mind as widely as possible regarding information and technology. Likewise with the business opportunities that can be created. Both are things that can be interconnected between their needs. A business can easily progress if it is supported by existing resources and analysis using technology. Therefore, I am interested in the field of Data Science so that I can focus on developing my abilities in analysis, understanding technology and business, and most importantly, problem solving based on existing conditions.

            My Project, called "HiSafe!" is a mental health application with various features that can
            meet the needs of its users with a simple, simple and complete
            appearance.
            One of the features is Articles, which are useful for users so they
            can get information about mental health such as tips, facts and news
            that is currently hot and of course related to mental health. Next
            is the Mood Tracker feature, which is useful for saving moods and
            seeing mood developments over certain time intervals. Apart from
            that, HiSafe also provides a Playlist feature, which is useful for
            relaxing the mind with calm music. By using this application
            regularly and following useful tips from counselors, users can feel
            changes in themselves for the better.
